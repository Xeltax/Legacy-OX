TypeScript adds optional types to JavaScript that support tools for large-scale JavaScript applications for any browser, for any host, on any OS. TypeScript compiles to readable, standards-based JavaScript. Try it out at the [playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/), and stay up to date via [our blog](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/typescript) and [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/typescriptlang).\n\n## Installing\n\nFor the latest stable version:\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g typescript\n```\n\nFor our nightly builds:\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g typescript@next\n```\n\n## Contribute\n\nThere are many ways to [contribute](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to TypeScript.\n* [Submit bugs](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues) and help us verify fixes as they are checked in.\n* Review the [source code changes](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/pulls).\n* Engage with other TypeScript users and developers on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/typescript). \n* Join the [#typescript](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23TypeScript) discussion on Twitter.\n* [Contribute bug fixes](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n* Read the language specification ([docx](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/blob/master/doc/TypeScript%20Language%20Specification.docx?raw=true),\n [pdf](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/blob/master/doc/TypeScript%20Language%20Specification.pdf?raw=true), [md](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/blob/master/doc/spec.md)).\n\nThis project has adopted the [Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/).
